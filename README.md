## Brief description of the site
This website is an interactive Party Planner built for my mum, who wants to start planning paid events as part of her business but often feels unsure about where to begin. The site helps her structure events step-by-step by asking about vibe, budget, guest count (up to 200), venue, timeline (up to one year in advance), and effort level.
Based on her answers, the site generates a full event blueprint:
Event type
Theme suggestions
A coordinated color palette
Decor, outfit, drink, and activity ideas
A structured planning timeline
An interactive checklist
A scalable shopping list
Copy-ready invite text
A polished PDF version of the final plan
The goal is to give her confidence, structure, and creative direction so she can turn event planning into a more organized, professional offering.
