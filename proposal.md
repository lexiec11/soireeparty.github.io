## Client Brief

**Client:** Georgie — my mum, who wants to start offering paid party planning as part of her business but often feels unsure how to structure events from idea to execution.  

**Purpose:** To create an interactive quiz-style website that generates a complete, professional party plan based on a few guided inputs.  

**Audience:** Individuals planning birthdays, dinner parties, themed events, and celebrations who need clear structure, creative direction, and an organized step-by-step plan.  

**Key action:** Complete the quiz and download a polished, ready-to-use party plan (PDF).

**Pages/sections needed:**
- Landing page with brief explanation and “Start Planning” button  
- Interactive quiz flow (vibe, budget, guest count up to 200, venue, time, effort, food, audience, event date up to one year ahead)  
- Theme reveal + color palette section  
- Timeline section (auto-generated based on event date)  
- Interactive checklist section  
- Scalable shopping list section  
- Invite text generator section  
- Download page / PDF export  

**Content status:** Core quiz logic, theme ideas, timeline structure, checklist items, shopping list logic, and invite text templates are developed. Still need final business branding details from the client (official business name, short service description, potential pricing structure, and contact information for future integration).

**Style preferences:** Clean and minimalist design with lots of white space, simple modern sans-serif fonts, structured layout, subtle accent colors, and a smooth quiz-style experience. The overall feel should be polished, professional, and easy to use, but still engaging and interactive.

**Inspiration sites:**
- BuzzFeed Quizzes — liked the interactive, step-by-step quiz format and satisfying results reveal  
- Typeform — liked the minimal, distraction-free design and simple one-question-at-a-time flow
